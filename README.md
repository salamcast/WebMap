# WebMap

It has been over 8 years since I touched this project and since I'm looking for new job, this looked the perfect app to containerize with Docker while learning it.  I have made some updates to the code, small fixes in the xHTML so it displays cleanly.   I have set the form method to GET, you can bookmark your scans to run them again as needed.
